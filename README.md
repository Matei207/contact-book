# Java Servlet & JDBC - Contact Book

## use servlet & jdbc 

```
Write a simple contact book web application using servlets and jdbc. You will then understand the underpinnings of the stateless request/response model of the web and direct SQL. Once you've gone though that pain you will have a deep understanding of why certain frameworks like Spring and ORM etc... exist
```


##  Netty/Jetty/Tomcat
```
If you want to do Java web dev I would recommend you to start with servlets and tomcat as servlet container. It'll help you to understand how a client-server communication works and how work most of legacy web apps. Then take a look at Spring MVC. it's a useful abstraction based on servlets (or Netty/Jetty). Finally try Spring Boot which is based on Spring and helps to build you application fast which is great for prototyping.
